# shpc4002_project2
2D Percolation using OpenMP and MPI Project 2 for SHPC4002 High Performance Computing

Project at University of Western Australia
Goals:
  - Implement percolation on a 2D lattice using both bond and site percolation.
  - Implement low-level OpenMP parallelisation across threads
  - Implement high-level MPI parallelisation across nodes in a cluster
